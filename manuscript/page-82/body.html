Enter Lysander.</p><p>Lys. Where art thou, proud Demetrius?
Speake thou now</p><p>Rob. Here villaine, drawne & readie. Where art thou?
Lys. I will be with thee straight</p><p>Rob. Follow me then to plainer ground.
Enter Demetrius.</p><p>Dem. Lysander, speake againe;
Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?
Speake in some bush: Where dost thou hide thy head?
Rob. Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,
Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars,
And wilt not come? Come recreant, come thou childe,
Ile whip thee with a rod. He is defil'd
That drawes a sword on thee</p></div> </div>
