deere,
If euer I thy face by day-light see.
Now goe thy way: faintnesse constraineth me,
To measure out my length on this cold bed,
By daies approach looke to be visited.
Enter Helena.</p><p>Hel. O weary night, O long and tedious night,
Abate thy houres, shine comforts from the East,
That I may backe to Athens by day-light,
From these that my poore companie detest;
And sleepe that sometime shuts vp sorrowes eie,
Steale me a while from mine owne companie.</p><p>Sleepe.</p><p>Rob. Yet but three? Come one more,
Two of both kindes makes vp foure.
Here she comes, curst and sad,
Cupid is a knauish lad,
Enter Hermia.</p><p>Thus to make poore females mad</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Her. Neuer so wearie, neuer so in woe,
Bedabbled with the dew, and torne with briars,
I can no further</p></div> </div>
