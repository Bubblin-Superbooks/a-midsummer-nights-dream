Thy crazed title to my certaine right</p><p>Lys. You haue her fathers loue, Demetrius:
Let me haue Hermiaes: do you marry him</p><p>Egeus. Scornfull Lysander, true, he hath my Loue;
And what is mine, my loue shall render him.
And she is mine, and all my right of her,
I do estate vnto Demetrius</p><p>Lys. I am my Lord, as well deriu'd as he,
As well possest: my loue is more then his:
My fortunes euery way as fairely ranck'd
(If not with vantage as Demetrius:)</p><p>And (which is more then all these boasts can be)
I am belou'd of beauteous Hermia.
Why should not I then prosecute my right?
Demetrius, Ile auouch it to his head,
Made loue to Nedars daughter, Helena,
And won her soule: and she (sweet Ladie dotes,)</p><p>Deuoutly dotes, dotes in Idolatry,
Vpon this spotted and inconstant man</p></div> </div>
