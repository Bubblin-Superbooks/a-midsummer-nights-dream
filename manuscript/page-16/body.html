How chance the Roses there do fade so fast?
Her. Belike for want of raine, which I could well
Beteeme them, from the tempest of mine eyes</p><p>Lys. For ought that euer I could reade,
Could euer heare by tale or historie,
The course of true loue neuer did run smooth,
But either it was different in blood</p><p>Her. O crosse! too high to be enthral'd to loue</p><p>Lys. Or else misgraffed, in respect of yeares</p><p>Her. O spight! too old to be ingag'd to yong</p><p>Lys. Or else it stood vpon the choise of merit</p><p>Her. O hell! to choose loue by anothers eie</p><p>Lys. Or if there were a simpathie in choise,
Warre, death, or sicknesse, did lay siege to it;
Making it momentarie, as a sound:
Swift as a shadow, short as any dreame,
Briefe as the lightning in the collied night,
That (in a spleene vnfolds both heauen and earth;)</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">And ere a man hath power to say, behold,
