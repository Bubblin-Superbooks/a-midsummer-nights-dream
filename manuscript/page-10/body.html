Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth,
Turne melancholy forth to Funerals:
The pale companion is not for our pompe,
Hippolita, I woo'd thee with my sword,
And wonne thy loue, doing thee iniuries:
But I will wed thee in another key,
With pompe, with triumph, and with reuelling.

Ege. Full of vexation, come I, with complaint
Against my childe, my daughter Hermia.</p><p>Stand forth Demetrius.</p><p>My Noble Lord,
This man hath my consent to marrie her.</p><p>Stand forth Lysander.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">And my gracious Duke,

And interchang'd loue-tokens</p></div> </div>
