Now thou and I new in amity,
And will to morrow midnight, solemnly
Dance in Duke Theseus house triumphantly,
And blesse it to all faire posterity.
There shall the paires of faithfull Louers be
Wedded, with Theseus, all in iollity</p><p>Rob. Faire King attend, and marke,
I doe heare the morning Larke,
Ob. Then my Queene in silence sad,
Trip we after the nights shade;
We the Globe can compasse soone,
Swifter then the wandering Moone</p><p>Tita. Come my Lord, and in our flight,
Tell me how it came this night,
That I sleeping heere was found,</p><p>Sleepers Lye still.</p><p>With these mortals on the ground.</p><p>Exeunt.</p><hr class="section"><p>Winde Hornes.</p><p>Enter Theseus, Egeus, Hippolita and all his traine.</p></div> </div>
