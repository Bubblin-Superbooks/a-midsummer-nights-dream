Do it for thy true Loue take:
Loue and languish for his sake.
Be it Ounce, or Catte, or Beare,

In thy eye that shall appeare,
When thou wak'st, it is thy deare,
Wake when some vile thing is neere.

For I vpon this banke will rest my head</p><p>Lys. One turfe shall serue as pillow for vs both,
One heart, one bed, two bosomes, and one troth</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Her. Nay good Lysander, for my sake my deere
