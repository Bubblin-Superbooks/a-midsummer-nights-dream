There sleepes Tytania, sometime of the night,
Lul'd in these flowers, with dances and delight:
And there the snake throwes her enammel'd skinne,
Weed wide enough to rap a Fairy in.
And with the iuyce of this Ile streake her eyes,
And make her full of hatefull fantasies.
Take thou some of it, and seek through this groue;
A sweet Athenian Lady is in loue
With a disdainefull youth: annoint his eyes,
But doe it when the next thing he espies,
May be the Lady. Thou shalt know the man,
By the Athenian garments he hath on.
Effect it with some care, that he may proue
More fond on her, then she vpon her loue;
And looke thou meet me ere the first Cocke crow</p><p>Pu. Feare not my Lord, your seruant shall do so.
Enter.</p><p>Enter Queene of Fairies, with her traine.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Queen. Come, now a Roundell, and a Fairy song;
Then for the third part of a minute hence,
Some to kill</p></div> </div>
