<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">further off yet, doe not lie so neere</p><p>Lys. O take the sence sweet, of my innocence,
Loue takes the meaning, in loues conference,
I meane that my heart vnto yours is knit,
So that but one heart can you make of it.
Two bosomes interchanged with an oath,
So then two bosomes, and a single troth.
Then by your side, no bed-roome me deny,
For lying so, Hermia, I doe not lye</p><p>Her. Lysander riddles very prettily;
Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,
If Hermia meant to say, Lysander lied.
But gentle friend, for loue and courtesie
Lie further off, in humane modesty,
Such separation, as may well be said,
Becomes a vertuous batchelour, and a maide,
So farre be distant, and good night sweet friend;
Thy loue nere alter, till thy sweet life end</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Lys. Amen, amen, to that faire prayer, say I,
And then end life, when I end loyalty:
Heere is my bed,</p></div> </div>
