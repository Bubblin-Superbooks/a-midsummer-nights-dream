<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">whom I see no blisse,
Curst be thy stones for thus deceiuing mee</p><p>Thes. The wall me-thinkes being sensible, should
curse againe</p><p>Pir. No in truth sir, he should not. Deceiuing me,
Is Thisbies cue; she is to enter, and I am to spy
Her through the wall. You shall see it will fall.
Enter Thisbie.</p><p>Pat as I told you; yonder she comes</p><p>This. O wall, full often hast thou heard my mones,
For parting my faire Piramus, and me
My cherry lips haue often kist thy stones;
Thy stones with Lime and Haire knit vp in thee</p><p>Pyra. I see a voyce; now will I to the chinke,
To spy and I can heare my Thisbies face. Thisbie?
This. My Loue thou art, my Loue I thinke</p><p>Pir. Thinke what thou wilt, I am thy Louers grace,
And like Limander am I trusty still</p><p>This. And like Helen till the Fates me kill</p></div> </div>
