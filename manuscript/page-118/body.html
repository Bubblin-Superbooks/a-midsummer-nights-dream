O Piramus arise:
Speake, speake. Quite dumbe? Dead, dead? A tombe
Must couer thy sweet eyes.
These Lilly Lips, this cherry nose,
These yellow Cowslip cheekes
Are gone, are gone: Louers make mone:
His eyes were greene as Leekes.
O Sisters three, come, come to mee,
With hands as pale as Milke,
Lay them in gore, since you haue shore
with sheeres, his thred of silke.
Tongue not a word: Come trusty sword:
Come blade, my brest imbrue:
And farwell friends, thus Thisbie ends;
Adieu, adieu, adieu</p><p>Duk. Moone-shine & Lion are left to burie the dead</p><p>Deme. I, and Wall too</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Bot. No, I assure you, the wall is downe, that parted

no excuse. Neuer excuse; for when the plaiers are</p></div> </div>
