Away, with vs to Athens; three and three,
Wee'll hold a feast in great solemnitie.
Come Hippolita.</p><p>Exit Duke and Lords.</p><p>Dem. These things seeme small & vndistinguishable,
Like farre off mountaines turned into Clouds</p><p>Her. Me-thinks I see these things with parted eye,
When euery thing seemes double</p><p>Hel. So me-thinkes:
And I haue found Demetrius, like a iewell,
Mine owne, and not mine owne</p><p>Dem. It seemes to mee,
That yet we sleepe, we dreame. Do not you thinke,
The Duke was heere, and bid vs follow him?
Her. Yea, and my Father</p><p>Hel. And Hippolita</p><p>Lys. And he bid vs follow to the Temple</p><p>Dem. Why then we are awake; lets follow him, and
by the way let vs recount our dreames.</p><p>Bottome wakes.</p></div> </div>
